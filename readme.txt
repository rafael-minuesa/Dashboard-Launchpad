WCAG 2.1 AA accessible admin dashboard with quick-access buttons to all WordPress areasâ€”perfect for screen reader users.

== Description ==

**Simple LaunchPad** appears as the first menu item in your WordPress admin, providing instant access to 15 carefully organized buttons across three categories: Content Management, Appearance, and Administration.

= Why This Plugin Exists =

If you manage multiple WordPress installations with different plugins (like I do), you know the frustration: plugin developers arbitrarily decide where their menu entries appear, constantly pushing core WordPress menu items like Themes, Plugins, and Settings up and down the sidebar. One site has "Plugins" at position 5, another at position 12, and yet another at position 8. You're forced to scroll endlessly, hunting for the same common entries you use every day.

**I got tired of complaining about it, so I did something about it.**

Simple LaunchPad puts all your most-used admin pages in ONE predictable location at the top of your admin menu. No more scrolling. No more hunting. Just click and go. This is my contribution to the WordPress communityâ€”a solution to a problem we've all experienced but rarely talk about.

Perfect for:
* **Site administrators** who want faster navigation
* **Agencies** managing multiple client sites
* **Developers** who need quick access to tools
* **Content teams** focusing on specific admin areas
* **Users with visual disabilities** who rely on screen readers and predictable navigation

= Accessibility Features =

Simple LaunchPad is fully **WCAG 2.1 AA compliant** and specifically designed to help users with visual disabilities navigate WordPress more efficiently.

**Why This Matters for Accessibility:**

When you manage multiple WordPress sites with different plugins, the admin menu becomes unpredictable. One site has "Posts" at position 3, another at position 7. Plugin developers arbitrarily inject their menu items anywhere, constantly shifting core WordPress items up and down. For sighted users, this is frustrating. **For screen reader users, this is a nightmare.**

Every time a screen reader user logs into a different site, they must:
- Navigate through the entire menu structure to find familiar items
- Re-learn where "Posts", "Pages", "Plugins", and "Settings" are located
- Tab through dozens of unfamiliar plugin menu items just to reach core WordPress functions

**Simple LaunchPad solves this by providing ONE predictable location** at the top of the admin menu where all essential WordPress areas are always accessible.

**Accessibility Compliance Features:**

âœ“ **Keyboard Navigation:** Full keyboard support with visible focus states
âœ“ **Global Keyboard Shortcut:** Press Alt+Shift+L (Windows/Linux) or Control+Option+L (Mac) to instantly open LaunchPad from anywhere in WordPress admin
âœ“ **Screen Reader Support:** Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
âœ“ **Skip Links:** "Skip to admin shortcuts" link for faster navigation
âœ“ **Descriptive Labels:** Each button includes clear, descriptive aria-labels (e.g., "Go to Posts", "Go to Settings")
âœ“ **Icon Accessibility:** All icons are properly marked as decorative (`aria-hidden="true"`)
âœ“ **Semantic HTML:** Proper use of navigation landmarks and heading structure
âœ“ **Large Click Targets:** 64px icons with generous padding meet WCAG touch target guidelines
âœ“ **Focus Management:** Clear visual focus indicators with high contrast
âœ“ **Consistent Location:** Always appears as the first menu item for predictable navigation

**Real-World Impact:**

Instead of tabbing through 20+ menu items that change position on every site, screen reader users can:
1. Log in to WordPress
2. Tab once to "LaunchPad" (always first in the menu)
3. Access any of 15 core WordPress areas with predictable, consistent labels

This reduces cognitive load, speeds up navigation, and makes WordPress administration accessible to everyoneâ€”not just sighted users who can visually scan the menu.
